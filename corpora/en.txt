the chinese government has been consistent from beginning to end in upholding the one-china principle and resolutely opposing any attempts to separate taiwan from china .
in order to strive for peaceful reunification , the chinese government has repeatedly appealed for conducting cross-strait negotiation on equal footing and on the basis of one-china principle .
there is only one way for taiwan in the future , namely heading towards reunification with the mainland motherland but absolutely not being separated from china .

under the planned economy system , during the 13 years from 1965 to 1978 , grain production costs rose by only 1.19 percent a year .
